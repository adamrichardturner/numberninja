# Number Ninja

Number Ninja is an engaging math practice app for all ages built by [Adam Richard Turner](https://adamrichardturner.dev) using React Native, Expo and Express.

It is designed to help users improve their arithmetic skills through timed questioned based exercises, analytics and performance tracking.

This is the Frontend repository containing the React Native app. The backend is a custom REST API built with Express and PostgreSQL and can be found [here](https://github.com/adamrichardturner/numberninja-api).

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Expo CLI
- Firebase account
- Backend server (separate repository)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/numberninja.git
cd numberninja
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a Firebase project and download the configuration files:

   - Create a new project in Firebase Console
   - Enable Authentication, Analytics, and Crashlytics
   - Download `google-services.json` for Android
   - Download `GoogleService-Info.plist` for iOS
   - Place these files in the project root

4. Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
EXPO_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
EXPO_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
EXPO_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
EXPO_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
EXPO_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
EXPO_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
EXPO_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id
API_URL=your_backend_server_url
```

5. Update the Firebase configuration in `firebaseConfig.ts` with your Firebase credentials.

### Running the App

For local development:

```bash
npm run start:local
```

For production:

```bash
npm run build:production
```

## üì¶ Building for Production

### Android

```bash
eas build -p android --profile production
```

### iOS

```bash
eas build -p ios --profile production
```

## üîß Configuration

The app uses several configuration files:

- `app.config.js` - Expo configuration
- `eas.json` - EAS Build configuration
- `package.json` - Project dependencies and scripts

## üåê Backend Setup

The app requires a backend server for handling:

- Game sessions
- User progress tracking
- Analytics
- Performance metrics

Ensure your backend server implements the following endpoints:

- POST `/api/sessions/create`
- GET `/api/game-modes`
- GET `/api/ranges-and-difficulties`
- POST `/api/sessions/:sessionId/end`

## üîí Security

- Firebase Authentication for user management
- JWT tokens for API authentication
- Secure data transmission with HTTPS
- Client-side input validation
- Server-side request validation

## üì± Supported Platforms

- iOS 13.0 and above
- Android API level 21 (Android 5.0) and above
